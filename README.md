## Description

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

This is a simple one page App (two to be precise ðŸ˜Š) I made to familiarize me with [`Shadcn/ui`](https://ui.shadcn.com/)

I split the [`Dashboard-03`](https://ui.shadcn.com/blocks#dashboard-03) example bloc into several components, propposing a way to wrap and split some Shadcn/ui components.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

You can find `Dashboard` main components in `src/app/dashboard/_components`.

The more generics components can be found in `src/components`.
